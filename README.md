# Unit converter

Write simple unit converter that supports conversions between units like kg/lb and cm/in. 
- It should be standalone application.
- Single-threaded.
- Result should be printed to console.
- Input is passed as a command line parameters
- It can use external tools and libraries
- Application should contain tests

Application should follow SOLID principles and it should be easy to add new conversions, for example liters to gallons.

Input format:

 `<value> <unit_to_be_converted> <unit_after_convertion>`
 
 for example
 
 `666 lb kg`
